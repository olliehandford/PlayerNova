# 🕹️ PlayerNova
We keep players accountable for their actions.

This is an old and unfinished project in Laravel and NodeJS to track player bans across multiple servers, and allow gaming communities to share information on bad players (e.g Hackers) via SteamIDs.

## How to setup

```composer install``` - install PHP dependencies

```npm install``` - install Node dependencies

```php artisan serv``` - start laravel development server

```npm run watch``` - start mix/webpack watch to wait for file changes
